Appart from Demo (which is written in Delphi), the examples in these directories 
are all in "simple" C and written as 32 bit console programs.

They have all been compiled and run using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0

In each case a blank console project was created, and the appropriate
source file added, together with the Aesimhei.lib file from the top level
SDK directory.

Note that in order to run any example, which all use the Aardvark interface DLL,
the DLL must be accessible. This should be in a Windows system directroy
( usually C:\windows\system32\ )
